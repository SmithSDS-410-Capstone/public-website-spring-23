# Pull out a piece of paper, and write three things you know to be true.

---

# Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

* **What does it mean** that you know this to be true? What counts as knowing?
* **How/through what means** do you know this to be true? 
* What are the **limits** of your knowledge on this?

# Epistemology

* Greek words
  * Episteme": knowledge; understanding
  * "Logos": reason; argument
* Philosophical study of the nature and limits of knowledge
  * What conditions must be met for us to say that we “know” something to be true?
  * How do a group of people come to acquire knowledge?
  
---

# What counts as knowledge?

* Historically knowledge defined as "justified true belief"

* Does knowledge exist independently of a knowing mind?

  * **Positivists** claim yes, there is objective truth independent of a knower

  * **Interpretivists** and **constructivists** claim no, truths are subjective or tied to a knowing mind
  
---

# How do we acquire knowledge?

* **Empiricists** claim that knowledge emerges from direct observation

* **Rationalists** claim that knowledge emerges from logic and reason

* ...and then there’s testimony, memory, intuition, feeling

# Understanding Check    

.pull-left[
* For empiricists, does knowledge emerge from inductive reasoning (thumbs up), deductive reasoning (streamers), or both (checkmark)?
* Is the scientific method inductive (thumbs up), deductive (streamers), or both (checkmark)?

# Feminist Epistemologies

.pull-left[

* All knowledge is **embodied**
  * Contrast with disembodied knowledge - i.e. not tied to a specific body
* Bodies are situated in certain social positions and have a finite point of view (Haraway 1991)
  * Critique of the "unmarked body," the "God trick," or the "view from nowhere"
* Knowledge is tied to particular standpoints 
  * Our experiences, what we’ve read, our education, our social positions, and what our bodies enable us to do, see, hear, taste, touch, and smell
  * Factors are innumerable and unique to every person
