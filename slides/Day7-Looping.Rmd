# What were some takeaways from Wednesday's class?

---

class: center, middle
# Think about a category or label that institutions assign to a group of people. Free-write for about 2 minutes on the following prompt: How does the existence of this category or label impact certain social groups?
---

# Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

* Why does this category or label exist?
* In what ways has this category or label been normalized in society?
* What happens when folks don't agree with the assignment? Can they contest it?

---

# Assemblages

* Contests the idea that data are hard, shiny objects that can be held, acquired, etc.
* When we talk about data, we are actually referring to many interrelated things:
  * Materialities, practices, subjectivities, places, governmentalities, etc.
  * See table in this week's reading
* "Data" emerges in the wake of these interrelated assemblages

# What were three takeaways from today?

---

# For Monday

* Complete group contract
* Questions to consider:
  * What does Biruk mean when they refer to "translation" in this chapter?
  * Where do we see looping effects in this chapter? What gets "lost in translation"?
