# Metadata Schemas

* A standardized labeling system for cataloging or describing data
* Enables search engines to index data by certain criteria
* Examples:
  * Sort by "date created"
  * Retrieve all results from a specific "author/creator"
  * Filter results to a specific "subject"
  * Exclude results from a specific "publisher"

# Data Dictionaries

* Documents for holding descriptive metadata
* Define the variables in a dataset and the values that may fill in those variables
* Are not always as descriptive as we'd like them to be

# For Monday

* Questions to consider:
  * What does Biruk mean when they refer to "translation" in this chapter?
  * Where do we see looping effects in this chapter? What gets "lost in translation"?
