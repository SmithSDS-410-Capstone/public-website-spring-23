# Identify something that meets Star's definition of an infrastructure. Jot down some ideas about how.when this infrastructure has broken down.

---

# Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

* How often do you think about this infrastructure? Did you notice it pre-breakdown?
* Who has a say in the design of this infrastructure, and who is excluded?

# Measuring Contaminants

.pull-left[
* Levels are not set based on potential impact to human health or degree of environmental degradation
* Levels are set based on the degree of precision that can be achieved by all laboratories
]

.pull-right[
* Minimum Reporting Levels for water pollution: minimum concentration at which EPA requires contaminant detections to be reported

# Case Study: Deforestation

* Select one team member to take notes and another team member to serve as an ambassador. 
* Imagine that your team has been hired by US to study deforestation in one of your team memberâ€™s home states. 
* To do so you will compare satellite data of forests in 2010 to satellite data today. 
* ...but first your team needs to decide what counts as a forest. 
* Together come up with a standard definition of a forest. Your definition should be **specific**. How are we going to figure out what land to include or exclude in the study? Jot this definition down.

# For Monday

* Questions to consider:
  * What's the difference between a prototypical and Aristotelian classification?
  * What cultural narratives can we draw from studying classifications?
