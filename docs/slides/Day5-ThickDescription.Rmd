class: center, middle
# Imagine you were an ethnographer attending Astro Hack Week. Write a quantitative research question for a study you might conduct. Now write a qualitative research question. 


---

# Turn to your neighbor and discuss:

* How would these research projects look different?

---

# Discliplinary Conventions

* What is considered a relevant research question?
* What kind of arguments are made?
* What kind of data is collected/produced/presented?
* How is collaboration valued?
* When/how is data shared?


---

# Disciplinary Genres

* Is text written in active or passive voice? Personal pronouns?
* Are subheadings chosen based on academic conventions?
* What kind of evidence is presented to persuade the reader? Statistics? Anecdotes?
* In what ways are research methods explicated?
* How and with what sort of detail are objects of study described?
* What role do poetics and metaphor play in the text? Can you identify emotion?
* What reflexive moves (self-reflection) does the author make? How do they elaborate their standpoint in/through the text?

# What is ethnography?

* Study of human cultures
  * Culture often defined as "semiotic"
  * Ethnographers aim to interpret the underlying meanings of surface actions and expressions
  * Make the "familiar strange"
* Often characterized as interpretivist and qualitative
* Typically involves extended, immersive fieldwork
* Has historically been a solo discipline
* Qualitative data rarely shared

# Methods of Ethnography

* Participant Observation
  * Observing interaction and behaviors "in the field"
* Interviewing
  * Engaging in semi-structured conversations with informants
* Archival Research
  * Curating and interpreting historical documents and artifacts
* Discourse analysis
  * Interpreting the cultural meaning interwoven in texts and speech
  
---

# Tools of Ethnography

* Field Notebooks
  * Document thick descriptions of observations
* Recording Devices
  * Audio and video documentation of interviews
* Coding Software
  * Draw out consistent themes of notes and interviews
