    "text": "This one-semester course leverages students’ previous coursework to address a real-world data analysis problem. Students collaborate in teams on projects sponsored by academia, government, and/or industry. Professional skills developed include: ethics, project management, collaborative software development, documentation, and consulting. Regular team meetings, weekly progress reports, interim and final reports, and multiple presentations are required. Open only to Statistical and Data Science majors.\nClasses will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:20 PM to 2:35 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSwaha Bhattacharya\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #sds-410-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I often don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\nMonday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331 Tuesday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331 Thursday, 11-12, Sabin-Reed 331\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis semester we will be reading selections from two books Discriminating Data: Correlation, Neighborhoods, and the New Politics of Recognition by Wendy Hui Kyong Chun and Data Cartels: The Companies That Control and Monopolize Our Information by Sarah Lamdan. The books should be available at the Smith bookstore.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via self-assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWurtele Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Wurtele Center is tremendously supportive of this course. Megan Lyster at the Wurtele Center will help facilitate some collaboration workshops in our course and help teams reflect on how collaborations are progressing. I encourage you to check out their resources and events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic Honesty\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttendance is essential in this course as you will be completing project work in-class with peers. If you must miss a class please inform me via Slack. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance this semester:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Office of Disability Services will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #sds-410-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Office of Disability Services in College Hall 104 or at ods@smith.edu. The Office will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ODS, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodleSlackGitHub\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#sds-410-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#sds-410-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course\nYou can also create private Slack channels with your project group members.\n\n\n\nI will be using GitHub Classroom to distribute several course assignments, and you will submit assignments by pushing changes to template documents to a private GitHub repository. I will provide guidance on how to do this early in the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio/RStudio Server\n\n\n\nThis class will use the R statistical software package. In the first week of the course, I will help you install and configure R and RStudio. If you are using a laptop, you will install both on that computer. If you are using a Chromebook or Tablet, an account will be created for you on the Smith College RStudio Server so that you can access a cloud-based version of RStudio. You should let me know in the first week of the course if you are using a Chromebook or tablet."

While I will not be formally reviewing these logs, I highly encourage you to stay on top of them in preparation for the mid-semester and final assessments.\n\n\nMid-Semester Assessment\nBefore leaving for Spring Break, you will write-up a 700-800-word mid-semester assessment of your work, grading yourself along each of the seven dimensions. For each dimension, you will develop an argument for why you should receive a particular grade (A, B, C, D, etc), drawing evidence from your log to support your argument. Your assessment should conclude by reflecting on areas for improvement in the second half of the semester.\nI want you to think of this assignment as an opportunity to generate material that you might reference when preparing job or graduate school materials. In cover letters and interviews, you may be expected to recall and detail specific instances where you demonstrated professionalism, where you learned to manage conflict in a collaboration, or where you overcame a challenge in project management. I’m asking you to provide specific examples in support of a grade, not only as proof of why you deserve that grade, but also because it will give you practice in effective self-advocating.\n\n\nFinal Assessment\nAt the end of the semester, you will write-up a final 1000-word assessment of your work in the course, grading yourself along each of the seven dimensions and providing evidence in support of a final grade. While you may reference examples that were included in the mid-semester assessment, this final assessment should be treated as a separate document than the mid-semester assessment, not a revision of it."

You will also be expected to deliver a mid-term presentation and final presentation, reporting on your team’s progress. To help you spread out the development of these products over the semester, I’ve broken out the final report into smaller chunks of writing to be submitted weekly. At a minimum, you must submit a final report and deliver a mid-term and final presentation to pass the course.\n\n\nReadings\nEvery two weeks, you will be expected to come to class having completed course readings. Every project team will be assigned to develop a discussion plan for one assigned reading and to lead one reading discussion. At a minimum, you must contribute to a discussion plan and help lead a reading discussion to pass the course.\n\n\nSelf-Assessments\nAt mid-semseter and at the end of the semester, you will be expected to submit individual written self-assessments of your work. At a minimum, you must submit both self-assessments to pass the course."

    "text": "There are many reasons that Git and GitHub are essential infrastructures for collaborative coding projects. For one Git saves snapshots of a code repository at different stages of a project so that we can track how it has changed over time and revert back to an older version if we discover a more recent error. We call this version control. Certain Git features also facilitate many people working on a coding project at once, by providing a number of tools to help prevent collaborators from over-writing each other’s work. These features also make it possible for developers to simultaneously modify, extend, and test components of the code without jeopardizing the project’s current functionality. I use GitHub for assignment submission in this course because it offers a number of features for commenting on and making suggestions in your code, which will be super helpful when reviewing your group projects. Further, GitHub supports code publication; by publishing code on GitHub, you contribute to an open access/free software community, enabling others to learn from and build off of your work.\nDespite all of these awesome benefits, there can be a significant learning curve when getting started with Git and GitHub. There are new vocabularies, workflows, and error mitigation strategies to learn when getting started. This lab is designed to help you get acquainted with the concepts behind Git and GitHub, suggested workflows for collaborating on projects in this course, and error resolution strategies.\n\n\n\nCreate, update, and close issues\nBranch a repo\nIssue pull requests\nAddress common push/pull errors\nAddress merge conflicts"

    "section": "GitHub Flow",
    "text": "GitHub Flow\n\ngit vs. GitHub.com\ngit is a series of commands available in our computers to save snapshots of files at different moments in time. On the other hand, GitHub.com is a website where we can store projects that have been configured with git commands. As you’ve been accepting assignments for this course, project folders (what we will call repositories) have been created for you at GitHub.com. If you navigate to GitHub.com right now, you will see a list of these project folders, and you can click through each of the them to see changes that have been made. However, when you created projects for each of these repositories in RStudio, you were using git commands on your computer to copy the project from GitHub.com to your computer. Similarly, you were using git commands when you staged, committed, and pushed your changes back to GitHub.com. In sum, git is a series of command line tools to manage changes to files. GitHub.com is a Web hosting platform for storing git projects.\n\n\nRemote vs. Local\nWe can store, edit, and publish files on GitHub.com without ever copying them to our local computers. Files at GitHub.com are technically stored on a server somewhere, so we will refer to the projects stored at GitHub.com as remote (i.e. distant, far-off, etc). Similarly, we can use git commands to save snapshots of different versions of files on our local computers without ever pushing the changes to GitHub.com, so we will refer to the projects stored on on our computers as local. In this course, we need the ability to move changes to files between our local and remote repositories.\nWhy can’t we just do everything at GitHub.com or everything on our local machines?? Well GitHub.com doesn’t have the nice environment for writing and running code that you have in RStudio, so we need to be able to move things to your local computers so that you can work on the code in RStudio. On the other hand, if all the work was done on your local computer and never pushed to GitHub.com, I (your instructor) would never see it! So the first important consideration in the GitHub Flow is how do we move changes made on our local machines to GitHub.com and vice versa.\nThe great news is that you’ve already been doing this! The primary way that we move changes between remote and local is through two git commands: pull and push. Pull copies changes from a remote repository to our local machines. Push pushes changes from our local machines to a remote repository. It looks like this:\n\nTypically, we want to make sure that we always follow this flow:\n\nPull changes from GitHub.com (remote) to local.\nMake changes locally,\nPush changes to GitHub.com.\n\nAs we are going to see later in the lab, the most frustrating issues with GitHub emerge when we break this flow.\n\n\nTo Branch or Not to Branch?\nIn my opinion, there are two kinds of workflows for GitHub. There’s the quick and dirty version, and there’s the long and elegant version. We just went over the Quick and Dirty version, and you’ve already had practice in it when submitting all of your labs for the course. Below are the differences between these two workflows (don’t worry about if you don’t understand what the steps mean right now; we will learn all of them in the lab).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick and Dirty Version\nLong and Elegant Version\n\n\n\n\n\nPull recent changes from GitHub to local machine.\nMake edits and save them\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.\n\nIn the quick and dirty version, all of this occurs in the main branch.\n\nCreate an issue at GitHub.com\nBranch the repo at GitHub.com.\nPull recent changes from GitHub.com to local machine.\nMake edits in the new branch and save them.\nStage and commit changes.\nPush changes from local machine to GitHub.com.\nCreate a pull request at GitHub.com\nAssign a reviewer to review the proposed changes and wait for their approval.\nMerge changes, while also closing the issue and deleting the branch.\n\n\n\n\nTypically I recommend the long and elegant version for group work as it is designed to avoid errors and ensure that collaborators are all on the same page regarding changes to files. However, occasionally when you have to make small, quick changes to a file, and it won’t impact your teammate’s work, it will make more sense to follow the quick and dirty workflow. The goal for today is to get practice in the long and elegant version.\n\n\nRepo\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate to GitHub Classroom to accept the assignment. For this assignment, you will work in teams of 3 at most.\n\n\n\nThis will create a repository at GitHub.com called github-practice. You’ll notice that the repository has a few files - README.md, github-practice.Rmd, .gitingore. You’ll also notice in the repo’s right sidebar that your group members are listed as collaborators. This means that you all have access to read and write to this repository.\n\n\n\n\nClone\nCloning is a git command that copies a remote repository to your local machine. In other words, it will copy all of the project files in the remote GitHub.com folder to your local computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nAll group members should clone the repo to their RStudio environment. To do so, copy the repo’s URL at GitHub.com. You will want to make sure you are in the main project folder when you copy this URL; it won’t work if you’ve clicked through to any of the files. Then in RStudio click on File > New Project > Version Control > Git, and paste the copied URL into the window that appears. Note what you see in the RStudio files pane after cloning the repo.\n\n\n\nRemember that cloning creates a copy of a remote repo on a local machine. In creating this project, you’ve copied all of the files that make up the github-practice repo at GitHub.com to your local computer. This means that you will find all of the files associated with this repo by navigating to the folder where you created the project on your computer.\nIt’s important to note that this is not just any old folder on your computer though. By cloning, you’ve created a git folder. This means that the folder has been set up in a way where git can track the changes that you make to it over time, and it knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with. If you tried to just create a new folder on your computer, it wouldn’t necessarily have these nice features.\n\n\n\n\nIssues\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate back to GitHub.com, and click on the repo’s Issues tab. Each member of your team should create an issue by clicking the ‘New Issue’ button. Title the issue: “Adding <your name> to the assignment.” Submit the issue, and to the left of the screen, assign the issue to yourself.\n\n\n\n\nIssues support project planning by allowing you to track changes you hope to make to your project over time. By assigning issues to certain collaborators on your project team, you can have clear documentation of who is responsible for what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn my own projects, I use Issues for a number of purposes. Sometimes I use Issues to bugs that I notice in my code that need to be fixed. Other times I use them to track features that I would like to add to my code down the road. Oftentimes, in my public repositories, I encourage others that are using my code to submit issues to ask questions about how something works, to report bugs, or to request features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBranch\nWhen you first create a repository, all of the code will be stored in the main branch of the repository. If you were to think of a project like a tree growing up from the ground, then the main branch would be the like the trunk of the tree. We don’t want the main branch to break because the whole tree could come down. One goal of a branching workflow in GitHub is to keep the most stable and polished versions of code in the main branch.\nSo what do we do in the meantime - when we’re editing code, potentially breaking things, trying to sort out its bugs, and it’s not quite in that stable and polished state yet? That’s where branching comes in.\nWhen we create a branch of our repo, GitHub creates a separate copy of the repo where you can make changes without impacting what’s in the main branch. Later, once we’re done making changes and things are stable and polished, we will have the opportunity to merge those changes back into the main branch.\nThink of it another way: You write a rockstar first draft of a final paper, and you decide to send it to a few friends to review. You could just share the original document with them and tell them “Have at it! Edit away!” The problem is that, if they are making changes directly to the original document, you could lose some of that awesome original text. A better option would be to create separate copies for each teammate to edit, send them those copies, and then figure out how to layer in their edits later. This is like branching. The original document would be the main branch, and each copy sent to a friend would be a branch off of main. Friends can make as many edits as they want in their branch because you still have the original stable and polished copy. Later, we can merge their changes back into the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBranching can get pretty wild in GitHub. You can have branches of branches of branches. I don’t recommend this. A good workflow is to create a branch for making specific changes, merge those changes back into main, delete the branch, and then create a new branch for the next batch of changes.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nClick on the Code tab on your repo’s page at GitHub.com. Directly below this tab, you will see a dropdown that is currently labeled “main.” This means that you are in the main branch. Each member of your team should click the down arrow, and create a branch by entering their first name into the textbox that appears, and then clicking “Create branch.”\n\n\n\n\n\nPull\nAs of right now, the branches that were created in the previous step only exist on GitHub.com, they don’t exist yet on your local machine. To get these changes to your local machine, you need to Pull the changes. Remember how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? When we pull changes to our local machines, we are basically saying, check that remote version for changes, and then pull them into the repo on my computer.\n\nQuestion\n\nHead back to RStudio. In the Environment pane, you will notice a tab labeled “Git.” It’s important to note that this tab will only appear in projects that are built from super fancy git folders. This is your RStudio command center for Git and GitHub. When you click on this tab, you will see a few buttons in the navigation bar. To pull changes, you should click the blue downward arrow. Click this button to pull the branches created remotely to your local machine.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Branches\nEven though you pulled the new branches to your local machine, you are still currently working in the main branch. Remember that we always want to keep the main branch stable and polished. This is not where we are going to make edits. Instead, you will make edits in the branch that you just created. Later, we will merge those changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the top right hand corner of the Git tab, you will see a dropdown currently set to “main”. Click the downward arrow, and switch to your branch by selecting the appropriate branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nMake Changes\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce in your branch, open github-practice.Rmd from the files pane. Decide within your group who will be Group member 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each group member should edit this file on their own local machines by adding their name and only their name to the appropriate location in the document (line 5, 7, or 9) based on their assigned number. It’s very important that this be the only section of the document you edit. Save the file by clicking File>Save.\n\n\n\n\nStage\nSometimes we make a changes to a few files, save them, and we’re ready to create a snapshot of our repo (i.e. create a commit) with some of those changes. Remember that creating this snapshot is almost like taking a photo of the repo at this particular moment, allowing us to later go back to that photo to see what the repo looked like in that moment. To let Git know which changes we want to include in that snapshot, we need to stage the files. Staging basically says, “these files are ready to be included in the snapshot.”\n\nQuestion\n\nOnce you save the file you’ll notice in the RStudio Git pane that the file name appears after a blue square labeled “M” (which stands for Modified). This means that the file is ready for staging. Stage the file - indicating that it’s ready for committing - by clicking the checkbox in front of the file name.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommit\nAs we just noted, committing changes basically means taking a snapshot of a repo at a particular moment in time. Commits are given unique hashes - sort of like a unique identifier that enables us to access the snapshot of the repo at a later date. In collaborative projects, it is typically recommended to commit often - after any major changes are made to a file. This ensures that we can eventually go back to look at very specific changes. It’s also important to label commits with descriptive titles so that we can recall what changes within that commit. Descriptive titles should detail what changes were made in the last round of edits.\nTo help put this into context, think back to our photograph metaphor. Let’s say that we are a photographer assigned to document how a baby develops in the first year of its life. If the photographer only took one photograph when the baby was 1 year old, we wouldn’t have a lot of documentation regarding how the baby developed! …so instead, let’s say that the photographer took a snapshot of the baby after every major milestone - their first laugh, their first solid food, their first crawl, their first word. We would have a lot more to go by when trying to understand how the baby developed. Same goes for committing code often.\nNow let’s say the photographer handed the batch of photos to the parents, and said - “look, here’s how your baby developed over time.” The parents might not remember which photograph was taken after which milestone. …but if the photographer were to label each photograph with things like “baby had first laugh,” the parents would be able to easily go back to specific moments in their baby’s development. This is why we want descriptive commit messages. We want to later be able to go back and scan through what changes were made after each commit.\nTo get a sense of what it means to be able to look back on these changes, check out the latest commits that I made to the GitHub repo for our course website. While I’m not going to claim to be the most diligent commit-er, you do get a basic sense of what changes were made to the repo following each commit from these commit messages. I could click through any of these links to see what my repo looked like at this moment in time.\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCommit your changes by clicking the ‘Commit’ button in the Git pane. When you click this button, a new window will open showcasing the changes that have been made to the staged file. You should enter a commit message in the window that appears. Remember that commit messages should be descriptive. In this case, something like “added <your-name>’s name” would work. Click commit. Now a snapshot of this version of the code repo has been taken.\n\n\n\n\nPush\nOnly your local machine knows that a change has been made to the code. Remember again how we said that the super fancy git folder knows that there is a remote version of the repository somewhere that you might want to keep it consistent with? Now we want to do the opposite of pulling changes from GitHub to our local machines. Instead, we want to push the changes on our local machines to GitHub.\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the Green upward arrow in the Git pane to push your changes to GitHub.\n\nOnce all group members have pushed their changes, head back over to GitHub. On the main code page, switch between branches and check out the contents of github-practice.Rmd in each branch. What differences do you notice?\n\n\n\n\nPull Request\nNote that now we have a few versions of our repo in separate branches on GitHub.com, and in each of those versions of the repo, the github-practice.Rmd file looks a little bit different. Now that we’ve made our changes and things are stable and polished, we want to move all of those changes into the main branch. To do this, we are going to issue a Pull Request. This is a request that signals to all of our collaborators that we are ready to move our changes back into the main branch.\n\nQuestion\n\nOn your repo’s page in GitHub.com, click the “Pull Requests” tab, and then click the green “New Pull Request” button. You’re requesting to pull the changes from your personal branch into the main branch. This means that the base branch should be main, and the compare branch should be your personal branch.\n\nYou’ll see a screen where you can compare your branch to the main branch. Click the button to “Create Pull Request,” enter a descriptive title of the changes made, and then click “Create Pull Request” again.\n\n\n\n\nReview Pull Requests\nI recommend that you get in the habit of reviewing your collaborator’s work before merging their changes into the main branch. By creating pull requests, we scaffold an opportunity to review each other’s work before fully integrating the changes.\nNow there should be a pull request for all members of your team. Assign one team member to review one other team member’s code. All team members should have one reviewer.\n\nQuestion\n\nOpen your own pull request in GitHub.com, and in the right sidebar, assign the team member responsible for reviewing your changes as a “Reviewer.”\n\nThen navigate to the pull request you are responsible for reviewing. Click on the “Files Changed” tab. Note that the left side of the screen shows the previous version of the file, and the right side of the screen shows the new version of the file. Lines in red have been deleted, and lines in green have been added.\n\nAfter looking through the changes, click the green button “Review changes.” Leave a note for your collaborator, indicating your evaluation of their changes. If everything looks good, check the radio button for “Approve.” If there are issues, check the radio button for “Request Changes.” Then click the button to “Submit Review.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf your reviewer requested changes, you should go back to RStudio, and make sure you are in your own branch. Then make the requested changes, save the file, stage the file, commit the changes, and push again. The changes to your file will be tracked in your pull request. After this, you may move on to the Merge step. See here for further options on dismissing or re-requesting reviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMerge\nOnce all reviewers have approved changes, we are ready to merge those changes into the main branch. Open each pull request. If everything is good and ready to merge, you will see a green checkmark that says “This branch has no conflicts with the base branch.”\n\n(If you get a message that there are conflicts, call myself or the Pedagogical Partner over.)\n\nQuestion\n\nClick the button to “Merge Pull Request”. In the comment box that appears, enter the text “closes #”. When you enter this text, you will see a dropdown of issues and pull requests currently in the repo. Issues will have an icon that appears as a circle with a dot in the center.\n\nSelect the issue associated with this pull request, and then click “Confirm Merge.” This will both merge the changes into the main branch and simultaneously close the issue you opened earlier. Finally, click the button to the delete the branch. Once this has been completed for all pull requests, head back over to the “Code” tab at GitHub.com, and check out github-practice.Rmd. What has happened to the file since merging the code? Navigate to the “Issues” tab. What has happened to the issues since confirming the merge?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next section...\n\n\n\nYou’ve now deleted branches at GitHub.com that your local machines don’t know have been deleted. By default, RStudio does not delete branches locally that have been deleted remotely, even after pulling changes. We can fix this by entering the following line into our Terminals in RStudio:\ngit config --global fetch.prune true\nRestart RStudio, and then pull changes (branch deletions) to your local machine by clicking the blue downward arrow. To streamline things in the next section of the lab, we are going to work entirely in the main branch (something that I would otherwise not recommend)."

    "text": "Error Resolution\nThe workflow presented above seems to work all fine and dandy. …but there are a number of factors that can impede this seamless workflow. In this final section of the lab, we will go over three kinds of errors that you might come across in the workflow above, and talk about how you would resolve them. I can almost guarantee that you will deal with some of these issues when working on your group projects, so I would encourage you to keep this lab handy when engaging in project work.\n\nPush error\nA push error occurs when we make changes to files on our local machines, and go to commit and push them to GitHub.com, but other changes had already been made to the file at GitHub.com that were not yet pulled into our local environments. We get an error because our local repo is inconsistent with the remote repo. To fix this error, we need to pull changes to our local machine, and try committing and pushing again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file README.md. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the text: ADD NAME 1 HERE ADD NAME 2 HERE, and so on with your names. Scroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message that your names were added.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. On line 40 change the ncol() function to dim(). Save the file. Stage and commit your changes. Click the green upward arrow to push your changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\nAn easy way to avoid a push error is to always click the blue downward arrow to pull remote changes before starting to edit files on your local machine.\n\n\n\n\nPull error\nA pull error occurs when changes have already been made to the same location (the same line number) in both a remote file and a local file, and then we try to pull the changes from the remote repo to our local machines. As far as Git can tell, there are two options for what this line is supposed to look like, and it can’t tell which to prioritize. So Git recommends that, as a first step, we commit the changes that we made locally. It’s basically saying, let’s take a snapshot of your local repo as it looks right now, so that later we can figure out what to do about this conflict.\nIf this seems confusing imagine this: let’s say you write a paper, and you share it with one of your classmates to review. The classmate reads through it, makes suggested changes to the opening sentence, and sends it back you. …but, while your classmate was reviewing the paper, you were getting antsy about the paper deadline and started making your own edits to the paper, including edits to the opening sentence. Now you’re trying to incorporate the changes from your classmate’s review, and you’re not sure what to do about that opening sentence. As a first step, you have two options you can scrap your recent changes (maybe your classmate’s suggestions were better!) or you can save a separate copy of the file with your recent changes and figure out later how to resolve the differences. That’s exactly what we are going to do here:\nTo fix this error, you should stage and commit your local changes and then try pulling again. Let’s replicate this error:\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should navigate to the GitHub.com repository. Click on the file github-practice.Rmd. Click the pencil icon to edit the file. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: colnames(pioneer_valley_2013).\nScroll to the bottom of the page and commit changes noting in the message how you updated the function.\nOther partner: Return to RStudio. Do not pull changes yet. Open github-practice.Rmd. Replace the code on line 47 with the following: ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\nSave the file. Click the blue downward button to Pull changes. You should get an error that looks like this.\n\nFollow the steps above to resolve the error.\n\n\n\n\nMerge conflict\nSo now we have these two snapshots of github-practice.Rmd, and they are in conflict with one another. If we try to push our changes back to GitHub.com, Git is not going to know what to do. Should the file at GitHub.com look like the version currently at GitHub.com, should it look like the snapshot that we just commit to our local machines, or should it look like something else entirely?\nLet’s return to the example of trying to incorporate a peer’s edits to a paper that you have recently made changes to. We have to figure out what to do about that opening sentence. Do we want our version, their version, or some combination of the two? This is what it is like to fix a merge conflict.\nTo fix this error, open the file with conflicts and edit the lines with conflict.\n\nQuestion\n\nOne of your partners should try to pull changes by clicking the blue downward arrow in RStudio. You will get an error that looks like this:\n{fig-alt=“This is the window that we see when we get a merge conflict. It says: CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md}\nTo fix this one your partners should open the file with the conflict. In this case it will be github-practice.Rmd. Scroll to the section of the file with the conflict. It will now look something like this:\n    <<<<<<< HEAD\n\n    ncol(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    =======\n\n    colnames(pioneer_valley_2013)\n\n    >>>>>>> ee175895783b64e0e1f696d9456be4c4c7c3f3bf\nThe code following HEAD represents the recent changes you made on your local machine, and the code right before the long string of characters represents the changes that were made in an earlier commit (the long string of characters is the commit hash). Decide what that line should look like and delete all other content. This means you must delete “<<<<<<< HEAD”, “=======”, and “>>>>>>> <long-hash>”, and you likely should delete at least one other line. Save the file, stage the file by clicking the checkbox next to the file in the Git page, and then commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding Merge Conflicts\n\n\n\nYou may have noticed that the most frustrating merge conflicts tend to emerge when we have two people working on the same line of a repo’s file. The most effective way to avoid merge conflicts is to ensure that collaborators are working on different documents or different lines in a file. One way you might do this when starting to work on your group project is to open a file that you all plan to work on and having one of your team mates section off space of that file for different people to work. It might look something like this:\n\nOnce this change has been made, that group mate should stage, commit, and push the file to GitHub, and all other group mates should pull the change to their local machines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPath of Least Resistance\nI have been working with GitHub for years, and even to this day, I run into instances where things become so inconsistent between my local machine and the repo at GitHub.com that the fastest way to fix things is just to save local copies of the files that I’ve changed to somewhere else on my machine, delete the super fancy Git folder from its current location, and then re-clone the most up-to-date remote version to my local machine.

    "text": "When working on collaborative code projects, it can be helpful to come to some agreements ahead of time regarding how to compose code and how to make changes to code repositories. Today, we are going to think through some of these issues by generating a code style guide.\n\n\nStandard formatting conventions are important for organizing, managing, and sharing code. Conventions ensure that: \n\nIf you were to step away from the project and come back to it in 5 years, you would be able to understand and navigate the code quickly. \nIf you were to share the repository with another developer, the developer would be able to understand and navigate the code quickly.\n\nHere are some questions that you should consider as you draft this section of your style guide:\n\nWhat standards will you use for naming files? (e.g. underscores, dashes, etc.) How will you ensure that file names are easily differentiated by all team members?\nHow will files be organized into folders in your repo? What will the main folders be?\nWhat standards will you use for formatting object names in your code? (e.g. underscores, dashes, etc.) How will you ensure that object names are easily differentiated by all team members?\nHow will you comment code? Where should comments be placed in code? What will their purpose be? Do you expect full sentences?\nWhat are the expectations for white space in your code? Will you include spaces between each symbol/punctuation mark? What about parentheses?\nWhen will line breaks be added to the code?\nWhat standards will you use for code indentation?\n\n\n\n\nDeveloping standard processes for code writing and review will help ensure that team members are not overwriting each other’s work, that code is consistently being reviewed before inclusion in the repo, and that generally everyone understands their roles in the repo’s maintenance. It will also reduce merge conflicts. Here are some things to consider when drafting this portion of your style guide:\n\nWill code always be written in separate branches? How will branches be named?\nHow will collaborators work across files? What mechanisms will you put into place to mitigate merge conflicts when collaborators are working on the same files?\nShould there be a GitHub Issue associated with each pull request?\nHow often do you expect team members to commit their code? (e.g. after each substantive change; after changes to x lines of code)\nWhat standards will you put in place for commit messages? What do you expect to see in a commit message?\nWhen/how often will pull requests be issued?\nWhen will you have team members review code? How will you designate that code needs to be reviewed?\nAfter a review, if changes need to be made, what will the code editing process look like?\nWho will be responsible for merging code?"

Because of this SDS recently adopted a curricular model called Writing Enriched Curriculum, which has enabled us to articulate the writing skills we hope our graduates will acquire. Since all majors are required to take capstone, the SDS Program has prioritized capstone as a space where writing should be meaningfully integrated into the curriculum. In other words, capstone is a space where you have an opportunity to demonstrate how your writing skills have developed.\nSince you are working with a sponsor, the final report serves as an important resource for generating detailed documentation of your project, including its aims, its methods, and its outcomes.\nThe drafting of a report gives you an opportunity to practice producing text that aligns with the genre conventions of our field.\nThe final report can hopefully serve as important portfolio material for you."

I’ve included an example below to help you think through how to approach this. At the very least this section should include:\n\nWhat the data represents\nWho produced it\nIts observational unit\nSome variables that describe that observational unit (but be careful about getting too technical here)\nA bit of its history/context\nA few data limitations\n\n\nTo address this problem, we analyzed a dataset put out by the US EPA [<– who produced it] that documents the environmental compliance and enforcement history of every EPA-regulated facility in the US, including prisons [<– what it represents]. For every EPA-regulated facility in the US in a given year [<– observational unit], the dataset reports information such as the permits the facility has been awarded, enforcement actions taken against the facility, and penalties it has assessed [<– variables]. The EPA has been integrating this data from a number of different compliance databases for major federal regulations (such as the Clean Air Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act) for over ten years [<– history/context].

After spring break, I will meet with each of the teams one-on-one to review your notes and talk about strategies for improving individual presentation styles. I can imagine that this aspect of the assignment might feel a little awkward (in fact, this was part of my own capstone in college, so I have some experience with that feeling!). …but in the past, I’ve found that having the opportunity to re-watch yourself present and a space to reflect on it can be really transformative in noticing things about our respective presentation styles. We will work together to create a supportive space for reflection.\n\n\nYou should prepare a slide deck to present in class. All members of your team will be expected to contribute to the delivery of your presentation. To ensure seamless transitions, I encourage you to practice “handing off” sections of the presentation.\n\n\n\nYour mid-term presentation should be about 10 minutes long (8 minutes minimum; 10 minutes maximum). This will allow 10 minutes for question and answer, feedback, and collaborative brainstorming following each presentation. Please rehearse ahead of time to ensure that you can meet this time benchmark.\n\n\n\nThe main goal of this presentation is to introduce the class to the primary goals of your project and the plan you’ve developed to achieve those goals. The presentation should include:\n\nan introduction to your client\nan introduction to the data/systems you will be working with\nthe scope of your deliverables\nan outline of the sprints that will bring you to completion\nyour progress so far\nany challenges that you are currently facing\n\nBe sure that your presentation opens with an introduction that highlights what you will discuss and closes with a conclusion that summarizes what you discussed.\n\n\n\nThe audience for this presentation will be senior SDS students.

Swaths of research indicate that learning improves when students are provided with explicit opportunities for this kind of reflection.\nThe ability to critically evaluate your own performance is an important skill that you will engage no matter where your career takes you post-graduation.\nThis assignment is designed to help strengthen your general review practices, by asking you to provide evidence and reasoning for a particular evaluation.\nThis assignment is meant to give you more agency over how you are assessed in this course.\n\n\n\nFollowing Spring Break, you should submit a 700-800-word mid-semester assessment of your work, grading yourself along each of the course’s seven dimensions. For each dimension, you will develop an argument for why you should receive a particular grade (A, B, C, D, etc), drawing evidence from your log to support your argument. Your assessment should conclude by reflecting on areas for improvement in the second half of the semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind!\n\n\n\nYour grade in this course is about growth. Your justifications should describe your growth along each dimension, not just how you met certain criteria in the dimension. This means that when you are identifying examples to talk about in your write-up, your arguments should explain how you developed new skills, new habits of working, or new ways of thinking through engagement in our course. It’s one thing to say: “I met the professionalism dimension by submitting materials on time and showing up to each meeting”, but that doesn’t tell me that you’ve learned anything in the course. Use this opportunity to engage deeper reflection on what new skills you’ve learned.\n\n\nYou should submit this assignment to your Github portfolio repository as a .qmd in the reflections folder. Please be sure to have separate headings for each of the course’s dimensions, and to clearly list the grade you would give yourself for each.\nI want you to think of this assignment as an opportunity to generate material that you might reference when preparing job or graduate school materials. In cover letters and interviews, you may be expected to recall and detail specific instances where you demonstrated professionalism, where you learned to manage conflict in a collaboration, or where you overcame a challenge in project management. I’m asking you to provide specific examples in support of a grade, not only as proof of why you deserve that grade, but also because it will give you practice in effective self-advocating."

It makes it possible to write documents in markdown and knit them in ways that align with various standardized formatting conventions. rticles documents can only be output as PDFs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is LaTeX?\n\n\n\nWhen you write text in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you are presented with a series of buttons that you can use to format the text in a number of ways. When you use the buttons to apply formatting to the text, the editor restyles the text right in front of you. You can see what the change looks like. We call this WYSIWYG - what you see is what you get.\nLaTeX, on the other hand, is a software system in which helps you develop documents with standardized formatting. You write in plain text and use a series of standardized symbols to mark how you want the text formatted. Separately, template files designate global formatting rules that will be applied to the document when compiling and building it. Importantly, LaTeX provides a standardized method for adding and formatting citations.\n\n\n\nInstalling rticles\nTo install rticles, in your console enter:\ninstall.packages(\"rticles\")\n\nQuestion\n\nInstall the rticles package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting a Template\nDifferent academic journals have different expectations for how manuscripts will be formatted. Journals may differ in things like: - where titles, authors, and abstracts appear in the text - fonts and font sizes - margins and margin sizes - number of columns - how headings and sub-headings are enumerated - how headers, footers and page numbers appear - …and so on.\nOnce the package is installed, you can select a template in RStudio as follows: File > New File > RMarkdown > From Template\nIn this course, we are going to use the MDPI template.\n\nQuestion\n\nA different group member should open your group GitHub repo. One team member should create a new RMarkdown file with the MDPI Template to be stored in the main directory. You can call this term-paper. This will create a folder with this name in your main directory. Commit your changes and have your team members pull the changes.\n\n\n\nWhen you create this folder, you will notice a number of files needed to compile the document. Here is a breakdown of some important files:\n\nthe .Rmd file is where you will compose the report\nthe .bib file is where the citations will be stored\nthe .cls file is where the rules for formatting the paper according to MDPI standards are stored. You don’t need to edit this file.\nthe .bst files are where the rules for formatting citations are stored. You don’t need to edit this file.\n\n\n\n\n\nYAML Header\nrticles will take care of most of the styling of your document for you via the rules in the .cls file. However to provide the system with the metadata it needs to format your document, there are a series of tags that you will fill out in the YAML header of the .Rmd file, detailing things like what is the title, who are the authors, what are the keywords, etc. Here is an example:\n---\ntitle: Short Paper\nauthor:\n  - name: Alice Anonymous\n    email: alice@example.com\n    affiliation: Some Institute of Technology\n    orcid: 0000-0000-0000-0000\n  - name: Bob Security\n    email: bob@example.com\n    affiliation: Another University\nabstract: |\n  This is the abstract.\n\n  It consists of two paragraphs.\nbibliography: sigproc.bib\ncsl: acm-sig-proceedings.csl\noutput: rticles::acm_article\n---\n\nQuestion\n\nHave all group members add their names and affiliations (including address) to the term-paper.Rmd YAML header. Note how, in this format, authors and affiliations are reported in two separate sections of the header. Discuss a strategy for avoiding merge conflicts when doing this. Be sure to Knit the document, and then commit, push, and pull changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnitting Error Resolution\n\n\n\nBecause rticles provides LaTeX based templates you may need to install or update LaTeX to Knit documents. If you get a Knit error suggesting so, you can either run:\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\ntinytex::reinstall_tinytex(repository = \"illinois\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an ORCID?\n\n\n\nAn ORCID is an ID used to uniquely identify people that publish things. Let’s say I published a paper as a graduate student. My affiliation then was Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. How does someone know that this is the same Lindsay Poirier that published a different paper at UC Davis or at Smith College? ORCID get associated with authors of papers in order to make it possible to uniquely identify authors that are constantly shifting affiliations. It also makes it possible to track an individual’s citations across different publishing platforms. You can register for an ORCID here if you don’t yet have one.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate an ORCID. Every group member should add their ORCID to the YAML header in term-paper.Rmd. Notice how this will go right below the affiliation. Knit, commit, push, and pull changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbbreviations\nNote that in this YAML header you can list abbreviations that may appear in your final report, and write out their longer phrases.\n\nQuestion\n\nAs a group, identify one abbreviation that will likely appear in your final report. Have one team member add the short and long version to the YAML header. Knit, commit, push, and pull changes.\n\n\n\nThere are several other sections of the YAML header that you should fill out as a team as you are putting together your first draft.\n\n\n\n\n\nCiting Sources\nZotero is a tool for managing citational metadata. It is a powerful way to keep all of the information you need to construct bibliographies in one place. We are going to use Zotero in this course because we will need to citational metadata to reference material in our final reports.\n\nQuestion\n\n\nIf you don’t already have Zotero installed, you can install it from this link. Click on the Download button and follow the instructions.\nDownload the Chrome Connector linked on the same page.\nNote that to be able to use the Zotero Chrome Connector, the Zotero app needs to be running on your desktop.\n\n\n\n\nWhen Web developers has designed web pages effectively, Zotero can parse the pages to pull citational metadata from the page. Most academic journals, news sites, and book publishers have set up their websites like this. We need this metadata to effectively build bibliographies for our final reports. To get the citational metadata for a source, you should follow these steps:\n\nOnce you have found the paper, article, or website you want to cite, click on the Zotero Connector extension on your Chrome window. This should be located in the top right corner of your Chrome window.\nThen, go to the Zotero app on your desktop. Locate the title corresponding to your source, right click on it, and then click on Export Item. This will open up an options tab.\nOn the options tab, make sure that :\n\n\n\nthe Format is set to BibTeX\nThe Export Notes box is checked\nThe Character Encoding option is set to Unicode (UTF-8)\n\n\n\nThen click OK and save the file.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nNavigate here, add the citational metadata to Zotero and then export the citation to a file on your computer.\n\n\n\nThese steps saved the citation in a bibtex format, which is a format that LaTeX can parse to create bibliographies. How do we then reference this citation in our projects?\n\nOpen the file where you had saved the citation created on Zotero.\nCopy the citation and paste it to the mybibfile.bib file in your term_paper folder created with the rticles package.\nYour newly added citation will look something like this:\n@article{CMS_HCC_Eval, title = {Evaluation of the {CMS}-{HCC} {Risk} {Adjustment} {Model}, {Final} {Report}}, language = {en}, pages = {127}, file = {Evaluation of the CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model, F.pdf:/Users/swahabhattacharya/Zotero/storage/AAWN6DS6/Evaluation of the CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model, F.pdf:application/pdf}, author = {Pope, Gregory C. and Kautter, John and Ingber, Melvin J. and Freeman, Sara and Sekar, Rishi and Newhart, Cordon} }\nThe @article at the beginning of the citation describes the kind of source you are citing. The CMS_HCC_Eval right after it is the name of your citation – this is what you will use to reference your source in your paper.\nNow, to reference this citation in your paper, go to the point in the text where you are citing the paper. Then, add the citation by adding the name of your citation to your paper like this [@name_of_reference]. This will look something like:\nCMS conducts comprehensive evaluations of its CMS-HCC model on a regular basis [@CMS_HCC_Eval].\nThis will automatically create a citation for you, which shows up at the end of the paper once you knit the .Rmd file.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nAdd the article that you just added to Zotero to your .bib file in term-paper. Then cite the paper you just added to Zotero somewhere in the text of term-paper.Rmd. Knit the document to ensure that the citational formatting worked."
